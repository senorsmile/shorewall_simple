#
# Shorewall -- /etc/shorewall/params
#
# Assign any variables that you need here.
#
# It is suggested that variable names begin with an upper case letter
# to distinguish them from variables used internally within the
# Shorewall programs
#
# Example:
#
#       NET_IF=eth0
#       NET_BCAST=130.252.100.255
#       NET_OPTIONS=routefilter,norfc1918
#
# Example (/etc/shorewall/interfaces record):
#
#       net     $NET_IF         $NET_BCAST      $NET_OPTIONS
#
# The result will be the same as if the record had been written
#
#       net     eth0            130.252.100.255 routefilter,norfc1918
